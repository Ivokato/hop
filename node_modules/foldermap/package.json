  "readme": "[foldermap](https://github.com/DeadAlready/node-foldermap) is a simple folder mapper for node.\n\n# Installation\n\n    $ npm install foldermap\n\n# Usage\n\nfoldermap traverses the folders in a given path and maps them into objects with the following properties:\n\n    {\n      _name: //Filename with extension\n      _base: //Filename without extension\n      _ext:  //Extension\n      _type: //'file' or 'directory'\n      _path: //Full path to the file\n      _content: //Handle to access file content or undefined in case of directory\n    }\n\nThose properties are not enumerable. For directories the files are added as enumerable properties\nwith _name being the key\n\n## Basic usage\n\n    //Async\n    require('foldermap').map('./testFolder', function(err, map){\n      console.log(map);\n    });\n    //Sync\n    var map = require('foldermap').mapSync('./testFolder');\n\n## Advanced usage\n\nInstead of path string you can also pass in an object or an array of objects with the following properties\n\n* path - required, the string path of file\n* type - limit the files to have a specific extension\n* match - regular expression string to match filename against\n* recursive - whether to traverse folders recursively, defaults to true\n* name - the name used for the property if file is in a list\n\n### Example\n\n    var map = require('foldermap').mapSync([{\n      path:'./testFolder',\n      recursive: false,\n      type: 'json'\n    },{\n      path:'./testFolder2',\n      recursive: false,\n      type: 'json',\n      name: 'test2'\n    }]);\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2012 Karl D端端na\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
